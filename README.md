## Agent Cowork

Agent Cowork is an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork — a desktop AI assistant that helps with programming, file management, and any task you can describe.

> Not just a GUI.  
> A real AI collaboration partner.  
> No need to learn the Claude Agent SDK — just create tasks and choose execution paths.



## ✨ Why Agent Cowork?

Claude Code is powerful — but it **only runs in the terminal**.

That means:
- ❌ No visual feedback for complex tasks
- ❌ Hard to track multiple sessions
- ❌ Tool outputs are inconvenient to inspect

**Agent Cowork solves these problems:**

- 🖥️ Runs as a **native desktop application**
- 🤖 Acts as your **AI collaboration partner** for any task
- 🔁 Reuses your **existing `~/.claude/settings.json`**
- No development environment or Claude Code installation required.



## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download a Release

👉 [Go to Releases](https://github.com/DevAgentForge/agent-cowork/releases)


### Option 2: Build from Source
